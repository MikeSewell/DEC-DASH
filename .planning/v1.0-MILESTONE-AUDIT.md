# Milestone v1.0 — Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Command Center
**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** GAPS FOUND (9 requirements pending across 2 unstarted phases)

## Executive Summary

Phases 1 and 2 are fully complete with all 13 requirements verified and passing. Cross-phase integration verified with 16/16 connections wired and 5/5 E2E flows complete. One cosmetic finding (skeleton grid mismatch). Phases 3 (Google Calendar) and 4 (Proactive Alerts) have not been started, leaving 9 of 22 requirements unsatisfied.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Newsletter Template Fix | 2/2 | ✓ Complete | NEWS-01-04 (4/4) |
| 2 | Dashboard Data Population | 4/4 | ✓ Complete | DASH-01-05, CMD-01-04 (9/9) |
| 3 | Google Calendar Integration | 0/3 | ✗ Not started | CAL-01-05 (0/5) |
| 4 | Proactive Alerts Panel | 0/2 | ✗ Not started | ALRT-01-04 (0/4) |

### Unsatisfied (9/22)

| Requirement | Phase | Description | Reason |
|-------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| CAL-01 | 3 | Google Calendar events sync via service account | Phase 3 not started |
| CAL-02 | 3 | Calendar sync runs on cron schedule | Phase 3 not started |
| CAL-03 | 3 | Admin configures calendar IDs | Phase 3 not started |
| CAL-04 | 3 | Dashboard widget shows today + 7-day events | Phase 3 not started |
| CAL-05 | 3 | Events display title, time, calendar source | Phase 3 not started |
| ALRT-01 | 4 | Grant deadline alerts within 30 days | Phase 4 not started |

| ALRT-03 | 4 | Sync status alerts for stale data | Phase 4 not started |
| ALRT-04 | 4 | Alerts display in attention panel | Phase 4 not started |

**Orphaned requirements:** None. All 22 requirements are assigned to phases.

## Integration Check (Completed Phases)

- **Connected exports:** 16/16 verified
- **Orphaned exports:** 0
- **Missing connections:** 0
- **E2E flows:** 5/5 complete (Newsletter generate+send, Dashboard QB connected, Dashboard QB disconnected, Client activity load, QB token refresh)
- **Broken flows:** 0
- **Unprotected routes:** 0

### One Cosmetic Finding

**ClientActivity skeleton grid mismatch (DASH-03)**
- `StatCardGridSkeleton` renders `lg:grid-cols-4` but `ClientActivity` data layout uses `sm:grid-cols-3`
- Effect: layout shift from 4-col skeleton to 3-col data at large breakpoints
- Fix: render 3x inline `<StatCardSkeleton />` in matching 3-col wrapper
- Severity: cosmetic — does not affect data rendering

## Tech Debt

### Phase 2: Dashboard Data Population
- ClientActivity skeleton grid mismatch (cosmetic layout shift on load)

### Total: 1 item (no blockers)
