# Milestone v1.0 — Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Command Center
**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** GAPS FOUND (18 requirements pending across 3 unstarted phases)

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 (Newsletter Template Fix) is complete and fully verified — all 4 NEWS requirements satisfied with passing verification, UAT, and integration checks. However, the milestone contains 4 phases total, and Phases 2-4 have not yet been executed. 18 of 22 requirements remain pending.

**Phase 1 is a clean success.** The remaining work is simply that the milestone isn't finished yet — there are no quality gaps or integration issues with what has been built.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Newsletter Template Fix | 2/2 | ✓ Complete | NEWS-01, NEWS-02, NEWS-03, NEWS-04 |
| 2 | Dashboard Data Population | 0/4 | Not started | DASH-01-05, CMD-01-04 |
| 3 | Google Calendar Integration | 0/3 | Not started | CAL-01-05 |
| 4 | Proactive Alerts Panel | 0/2 | Not started | ALRT-01-04 |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 1 — Complete

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| NEWS-01 | SATISFIED | 01-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| NEWS-02 | SATISFIED | 01-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| NEWS-03 | SATISFIED | 01-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| NEWS-04 | SATISFIED | 01-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |

### Phases 2-4 — Pending

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DASH-01 through DASH-05 | Phase 2 | Pending (not started) |
| CMD-01 through CMD-04 | Phase 2 | Pending (not started) |
| CAL-01 through CAL-05 | Phase 3 | Pending (not started) |
| ALRT-01 through ALRT-04 | Phase 4 | Pending (not started) |

**Orphaned requirements:** None. All 22 requirements are assigned to phases.

## Integration Check

Phase 1 integration verified by gsd-integration-checker:

- **Connected exports:** 5/5 (buildNewsletterHtml, juice dual-pass, trackingImage, generateEmailHtml action, size pill)
- **Orphaned exports:** 0
- **Missing connections:** 0
- **E2E flows:** 2/2 complete (Generate HTML flow, Preview with disclaimer flow)
- **Broken flows:** 0
- **Unprotected routes:** 0

No cross-phase integration issues exist. Phase 1 is fully isolated (as designed) with no dependencies on Phases 2-4.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. Phase 1 implementation is clean with no TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or placeholders.

## Conclusion

The milestone is not yet complete — 3 of 4 phases remain. However, the work that HAS been done (Phase 1) is solid: fully verified, UAT-tested, and integration-checked with zero gaps. The remaining phases should proceed in order: Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4.
