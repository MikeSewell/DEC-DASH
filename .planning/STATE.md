# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** When Kareem opens this app each morning, he immediately sees the financial picture, client activity, upcoming deadlines, and what needs his attention — without switching tools or digging through data.
**Current focus:** Defining v1.1 requirements

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Google Calendar service account must be manually shared with each calendar before sync works — silent empty-result failure mode
- Alert thresholds (30-day deadline window, 15% budget variance) should be validated with Kareem — being addressed in v1.1
- npx convex dev --once fails with auth error in non-interactive terminal — Convex deploys must be run interactively by user
