# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** When Kareem opens this app each morning, he immediately sees the financial picture, client activity, upcoming deadlines, and what needs his attention — without switching tools or digging through data.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: v1.0 SHIPPED
Status: Milestone v1.0 Command Center complete — 4 phases, 11 plans, 22/22 requirements satisfied
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Milestone archived, git tagged v1.0

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Google Calendar service account must be manually shared with each calendar before sync works — silent empty-result failure mode
- Alert thresholds (30-day deadline window, 15% budget variance) should be validated with Kareem to avoid alert fatigue
- npx convex dev --once fails with auth error in non-interactive terminal — Convex deploys must be run interactively by user
