# Milestone v1.1 Polish — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 2/8 requirements satisfied

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| Requirement | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| DASH-01 | KPI cards show YoY trend indicator | Phase 5 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |
| DASH-02 | Trend data from QB historical P&L | Phase 5 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |
| CAL-01 | Calendar events color-coded by type | Phase 6 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| CAL-02 | Imminent events show countdown badges | Phase 6 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| CAL-03 | Toast notification for events within 30-60 min | Phase 6 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| ALRT-01 | Admin Alerts config + gear icon shortcut | Phase 7 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| ALRT-02 | Alert dismissal with session persistence | Phase 7 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |
| ALRT-03 | New/changed alerts trigger sonner toasts | Phase 7 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |

**Orphaned requirements:** 0

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Plans | Verification | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| 5 | Dashboard KPI Trends | ✓ Complete | 1/1 | passed (5/5) | DASH-01 ✓, DASH-02 ✓ |
| 6 | Calendar Enhancements | ✗ Not started | 0/? | missing | CAL-01, CAL-02, CAL-03 |
| 7 | Alert Configuration & Persistence | ✗ Not started | 0/? | missing | ALRT-01, ALRT-02, ALRT-03 |

## Integration Check

**Phase 5 Internal Wiring:** All 4 exports consumed, 0 orphaned, 0 missing connections.

**E2E Flow — KPI Trend Display:** COMPLETE
- Cron sync → fetchPriorYearPnl → cache → getTrends query → useTrends hook → ExecutiveSnapshot → StatCard SVG arrows

**Cross-Phase Issues:** None (Phases 6 and 7 not started — no cross-wiring to verify yet)

### Planning Implications for Remaining Phases

**Phase 6 (Calendar):**
- CAL-01: `googleCalendarCache` schema has no `eventType` field — migration or runtime inference needed
- CAL-02: `getEvents` query window (today +8 days) supports countdown badges
- CAL-03: Toast infrastructure exists; de-duplication pattern needs `sessionStorage` keying

**Phase 7 (Alerts):**
- ALRT-01: All thresholds hardcoded in `convex/alerts.ts` — needs new `alertConfig` table + admin tab
- ALRT-02: Alert IDs are deterministic strings — good foundation for per-user dismissal keying
- ALRT-03: Requirement specifies sonner but codebase uses custom `Toast.tsx` — must resolve

---

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. Phase 5 had 0 anti-patterns, 0 TODOs, 0 stubs.

---

## Summary

Phase 5 (Dashboard KPI Trends) is complete and verified with full internal integration. However, Phases 6 and 7 have not been planned or executed, leaving 6 of 8 milestone requirements unsatisfied. The milestone cannot pass audit until all phases are complete.
